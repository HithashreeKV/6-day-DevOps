Key Concepts of Cloud and AWS
Fast Delivery
Cloud services offer faster deployment and delivery of resources, improving time-to-market.

Quality
Reliable infrastructure ensures consistent performance and minimal downtime.

Lesser Spending
Pay-as-you-go model helps in reducing upfront costs and unnecessary spending.

Availability
Services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

Cloud as Remote Services
Cloud computing provides services remotely over the internet such as computing power, storage, and software.

AWS & Data Centers
AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Leading cloud service provider offering infrastructure, platform, and software services.

Data Centers in India

Mumbai

Hyderabad

What is a Data Center?
A data center is a collection of servers and storage systems maintained by a cloud provider.

Cloud Service Models
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., Amazon EC2).

PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk).

SaaS (Software as a Service)
Delivers software over the internet on a subscription basis (e.g., Gmail, Google Docs).

AWS Key Features
Auto Scaling
Automatically adjusts computing capacity based on demand.

Availability
AWS ensures 99.11% uptime for most services.

On-Demand
Resources are provisioned and billed as needed.

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Scalable virtual servers in the AWS cloud.

Containers & Kubernetes

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
The most trusted way to run and scale Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

Linux Server Configuration & Deployment
OS & Server Setup Required for Application Deployment
Without a properly configured OS and server environment, deployment cannot happen.

Popular Linux Server Families:

Red Hat Family:
Includes Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE Linux
Uses httpd (daemon) to handle web services and responses.

Debian Family:
Includes Ubuntu and Debian OS
Uses apache2 or nginx servers.

Deployment Process
Common Commands Used
bash
Copy
Edit
# Connect to EC2 instance using a key
chmod 400 "Hithashree-webserver.ppk"
ssh -i "Hithashree-webserver.ppk" ec2-user@ec2-51-20-55-106.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

# Gain sudo privileges
visudo
sudo su

# Install Apache Web Server
yum install httpd
which httpd

# Start Apache service
service httpd start
service httpd status

# Install Git and clone repository
yum install git -y
git clone -b master https://github.com/HithashreeKV/Coursevita-Retail-Project.git
git clone -b main https://github.com/HithashreeKV/Oracle-Training-Retail.git

# Navigate to the cloned project
cd Oracle-Training-Retail

# Copy project files to Apache root directory
cp -r . /var/www/html

# Restart Apache
